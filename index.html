            <h3>Transfagarasan</h3>
            <p>
                The Transfagarasan was built between 1970 and 1974 by military forces. After the 1968 invasion of
                Czechoslovakia by the Soviets, Nicolae Ceausescu had it built as a strategic military route to cross
                the
                mountains in the event the Soviets attempted a similar move into Romania. The builders used 6000
                tons of
                dynamite to clear a path for the road on the northern side of the mountains (this is the most
                spectacular)
                and on the tunnel.

                The road has more tunnels and viaducts then any other road in Romania. On the highest point of the
                Transfagarasan near Balea Lake is located the longest, and highest tunnel of Romania. This tunnel is
                the
                connection between Transsylvania and Walachia.

            <h3>Balea Lake</h3>
            <p>
                Bâlea Lake is situated at the altitude of 2034 meters in the highest mountain chain of the
                Carpathians -
                The
                Făgărași Mountains. The first thing you will see here, if you come from the north, is the Bâlea
                Waterfall,
                which is only 10 km away from the lake and surrounded by breathtaking scenery. The waterfall and
                the
                lake on
                top of the mountains are must-see destinations for all nature enthusiasts.
                The glacier lake was formed when a glacier eroded the mountains and melted leaving behind one of
                Romania’ most beautiful lakes. The name Bâlea Lake comes from a local legend, a story of the shepherd
                Bâlea,who
                was
                in the mountains with his sheep when a bear attacked them. He fought the bear and managed to
                defeat
                it,
                chasing it into the woods. When the king heard of Bâlea’s bravery, he invited him to join his
                royal
                guard at
                the castle, where he fell in love with the king’s daughter. They decided to get married, but on
                their
                wedding day, a big storm occurred, that took their lives. The locals named the lake after the
                brave
                shepherd.

            <h3>Vidraru Dam</h3>
            <p>
                Vidraru Dam, one of Ceausescu's megastructures, was completed in 1966 on the Argeș River and created
                Vidraru
                Lake, with the primary purpose of serving a hydroelectric power plant.

                The dam's height is 166 meters (548 ft) and it can store 465 million cubic meters of water. The
                reservoir
                has a total shoreline length of 28 km (18 miles).

                The dam's construction took 5 and a half years. It required 42 km (26 miles) of tunnels, excavation
                of
                1,768,000 cubic meters of hard rocks, 930,000 cubic meters of concrete and required the installation
                of
                6,300 tons of electro-mechanical equipment. When completed, it ranked 5th in Europe, and 9th in the
                world.
                As 2020, Vidraru Dam is the 16th tallest dam in Europe.

                The Transfagarasan road passes over the top of the dam, which is 305 meters (1,006 ft) in length.
                Also,
                during the summer there are boat trips on the lake.
